	<h1>Purpose</h1>
	<p>The first 48 hours following a natural disaster is crucial to finding any survivors or injured victims that may be trapped under rubble and debris. Many different disasters, such as earthquakes, occur throughout the world bringing with them chaos and complete destruction that requires a huge number of manpower to survey and search for victims that may be trapped and immobilized. The real problem first responders and rescuers face is locating the survivors that may be tangled in a mess beneath amounts of rocks, rubble, and debris.</p>
	<p> The solution to this problem is solved by deploying multiple drones to scan the affected area by detection of personal electronic devices, thermal imaging, audio signals, and live feed-back video. Once a drone confirms the location of a trapped person, that information is then relayed back using mesh networks of the individual drones to the control center, and a map with the appropriate coordinates is created through software as a guide to help first responders quickly locate and extract the people affected by the calamity.</p>
